# Fake-New-Classification: : Exploring NLP Techniques

This repository contains the code and resources for an NLP project investigating fake news detection using the Kaggle Fake News dataset.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) techniques for identifying fake news articles. This includes:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the textual data for analysis.
Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text that might indicate fakeness.
Model development: Building and training machine learning models to classify news articles as real or fake.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models and comparing different approaches.

## Results
This project achieved a validation accuracy of 99%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LSTM algorithm in identifying fake news articles.
